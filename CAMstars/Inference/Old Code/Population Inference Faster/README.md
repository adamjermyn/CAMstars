In this directory we use Nested Sampling to infer abundances for populations of stars.
We infer the population bulk abundance as well as the relative depletion/enhancement of
the accreting material.

We pre-compute a prior over the bulk abundances based on field stars with no accretion.
This is done analytically. We then assume a strict relationship between the bulk and
accreted abundance and infer the details of the accretion. Because the bulk inference
is done analytically the rest may be done for each star independently.
