In this directory we use Nested Sampling to infer abundances for populations of stars.
We infer the population bulk abundance as well as the relative depletion/enhancement of
the accreting material.

We pre-marginalize over the bulk abundances, as we can do that analytically. The details
of that calculation are in main.pdf.
